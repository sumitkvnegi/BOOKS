# The 10X rule - The only difference between success and failure.

![enter image description here](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51euytVd+HL.jpg)

* Anyone who suggests to me to do less is either not a real friend or very confused!
* The first thing that has to happen is for you to adjust your thinking to 10X levels and your actions to 10X quantities.
* Setting the right targets, estimating the mandatory effort, and operating at the right level of action(s) are the only things that will guarantee success.
* The 10X rule is based on understanding how must effort thought is required to get anything done successfully.
* Success is the degree or measure of attaining some desired object or end.
* An interesting thing about success is that it's like a breath of air; although your last breath of air is important, it's not nearly as important as the next one.
* No matter how much you've already achieved, you will desire to continue making accomplishments in the future. it is you who stops trying to succeed, it's like trying to live the rest of your life off the last breath of air. things change; nothing remains as it was for things to be maintained, they require attention and action.
* Common to all of the desire is the desire to improve.
* Limiting the amount of success you desire is a violation of the 10X rule in and of itself. when people start limiting the amount of success they desire, I assure you they will limit what will be required of them in order to achieve success and will fail miserably at doing what it takes to keep it.
* You must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times what you think it will take to accomplish those targets.
* The 10X rule is about pure domination mentality.
* Even take actions that you might deem "unreasonable".
* Basic series of mistakes:-

1. mistargeting by setting objectives that are too low and don't allow for enough correct motivation.
2. severely underestimating what it will take in terms of actions, resources, money, and energy to accomplish the target.
3. spending too much time competing and not enough time dominating their sector.
4. underestimating the amount of adversity they will need to overcome in order to actually attain their desired goal.

* People were operating with a herd mentality - one based on competition instead of domination, they think in terms of "I have to do what my colleague/neighbor/family members doing" instead of "I have to do what's best for me".
* Why spend your life making only enough money to end up with not enough money?
  why work out in the gym only once a week, just to get sore and never see a change in your body type? why get merely "good" at something when you know the marketplace only rewards excellence? why work eight hours a day at a job where you could be a superstar and perhaps even run or own the place? all these examples require energy. only your 10X targets really pay off!.
* The word "Success" is derived from the Latin "succeeder" - > which means "to turn out well or to attain a desired object or end".
* A person who limits his or her potential success will limit what he or she will do to create and keep it.

# Why the 10X rule is vital

* The 10X rule assumes the target is never the problem. any target attacked with the right actions in the right amount with persistence is attainable.
* When you start rethinking your targets, making up excuses, and letting your self off the hook, you are giving up on your dreams. (Never reduce a target instead increase actions.)
* Mankind seems to have this build-in, automatic calculator whose only purpose is to explain away failure. (this calculator tends to be more emotional than logical; it judges the project, clientele, economy, and individual to be deficient as a means of justifying why things are not working out. this is probably due to all the false content that has been loaded into the calculations by the media, educational system, and our upbringings - excuses like, "the market isn't ready", "the economy is bad", "this isn't wanted", "I'm not cut out for this", "our targets were unrealistic", and on and on.)
* Manage every action as though you have a camera on you every step of the way. pretend you're being recorded as a model by which your children and grandchildren will learn how to succeed in life. attack everything with the ferociousness of a champion athlete who is getting his last opportunity to claim this pages in the history books.
* Approach every situation with an "in-it-to-win-it"/"whatever-it-takes" mind-set.

# what is success

* The definition of success really depends on when a person is in life or what has his or her attention.
* The most crucial things to know about success - in order to have it and keep it ->

  > Success is important
  > Success is your (my) duty
  > There is no shortage of success
  >
* It is not enough just to play the game; it is vital that you learn to win at it. winning over and over again - at everything in which you involve yourself ensures that you will be able to further expand. and it guarantees that both you and your ideas will survive in to the future.
* Success is equally important to a person's sense of self. it promotes confidence, imagination, and a sense of security and emphasizes the significance of contributing.
* No one will benefit from your failure. however, if you were able to reverse it and attain the goals and dreams you set for yourself - now, that would be something.

# Success is your duty

* The greatest turning points in our lives occur when we stop casually waiting for success and instead start to approach it as a duty, obligation, and responsibility - rather than as something that may or may not happen to us.
* The greater quantities of success are necessary than most people calculate, and the continued pursuit of success should be approached not as a choice but as an absolute must.
* People don't approach the creation of success as a must-have obligation, do-or-die mission, gotta-have-it, "hungry-dog-on-the-back-of-a-meat-truck" mentality. they then spend the rest of their lives making excuses for why they didn't get it. and that is what happens when you consider success to be an alternative rather than an obligation.
* Quit lying to yourself
* It is fairly common for people who don't get what they want to provide justifications - and even lie to themselves - by minimizing how valuable success is to them.
* It is entirely okay to admit that you wanted something that didn't come to fruition. In fact, this is the only thing that will help you eventually reach that goal.
* Luck is just one of the byproducts of those who take the most action. the world pays attention only when they're winning. "The harder I work, the luckier I get".

# There is no shortage of success

* Unfortunately, most people look at success as though it is some how a scarcity. they tend to think that if someone else is successful, it will some how inhibit their ability to create success.
* Success is created not acquired.
* The notion of competition suggests that if one person wins, someone else must lose. although this might be true in a board game, where the goal is to produce one winner, this is not the reality with regard to success in business and in life.
* The founders of google didn't stop the creation of facebook, nor did two decades of microsoft's dominance prevent steve jobs from raising apple's profile with iPods, iPhones, and iPads.
* The shortage myth perpetuated by most of the population via expressions of envy, disagreement or constant reports in the media of shortages of jobs, money, opportunities etc.
* To get beyond the shortage myth, you have to shift your thinking to see that other's achievements actually create an opportunity for you to win as well. "success for anyone or any group is ultimately a positive contribution to all people and all groups as it provides validation of the possibilities to all.

# Assume control for everthing
