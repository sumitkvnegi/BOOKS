It is seen as a way to support governments because central banks and governments hold gold reserves as part of their currency and economic stability strategies. Individuals and investors often buy gold as a way to protect their wealth from inflation and economic instability. Gold can be viewed as a safeguard for preserving wealth.

Investing in silver can be seen as supporting industries that rely on this precious metal for their operations. While silver can also serve as a store of value, it is more closely tied to industrial demand.
