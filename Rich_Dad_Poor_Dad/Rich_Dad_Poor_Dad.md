* There is a difference in between being poor and being broke, **Broke is temporary**, Poor is eternal.
* **Life is the best teacher of all**. Most of the time, life dosen't talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, " ***Wake up, There's something I want you to learn*** ".
* If you think I'm the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. Most people want everyone in the world to change but themselces. Let me tell you, ***It's easier to change yourself*** than everyone else.
