* There is a difference in between being poor and being broke, **Broke is temporary**, Poor is eternal.
* **Life is the best teacher of all**. Most of the time, life dosen't talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, " ***Wake up, There's something I want you to learn*** ".
* If you think I'm the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. Most people want everyone in the world to change but themselces. Let me tell you, ***It's easier to change yourself*** than everyone else.
* As governments expand and need more and more money, the only place to get it is the middle class. that means the workers. every government now favours the professional investors and business owners pay very little tax, if they use the tax law as intended - as a tool to build the economy.
* Every person has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought, and every individual also had a part of their soul that was resilient and could never be bought. it was only a question of which one was stronger.
* People's lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.
* Fear -> of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck. Greed ->  starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. the pattern is then set.
* The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money.
* So many people say, "oh, I'm not interested in money". yet they'll work at a job for eight hours a day. That's a denial of truth.
* "Emotions are what make us human. the word 'emotion' stands for 'energy in motion'. be truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in your favour, not against yourself".
* "When a person says, 'I need to find a job', it's most likely an emotion doing the thinking. fear of not having money generates that thought". [All I'm saying is that It's fear that is all too often doing thinking]
* By not giving into your emotions, you will able to delay your reactions and think that is important.
* From here on in, it's imperative for you to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not let you emotions control your thinking.
* It is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and fear.
* When emotion goes up, intelligence goes down.
* Learn to differentiate between emotion thinking and the head thinking.
* The problem was that creating money is legal for the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do. there are legal ways to create money from nothing.
* Rich know that money is an illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. it's only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions of people who believe that money is real.
