### The 148,000 “NO’S!”

During the first eighteen years of our lives, if we grew up in fairly average, reasonably positive homes, we were told “No!” or what we could not do, more than 148,000 times! If you were a little more fortunate, you may have been told “No!” only 100,000 times, or 50,000 times—however many, it was considerably more negative programming than any of us need.

> Eventually, we believed what others told us and what we told ourselves most; we began to live out the picture of ourselves we had created in our minds.

Year after year, word by word, our life scripts were etched. Layer by layer, nearly indelibly, our self-images were created. In time, we ourselves joined in. We began to believe that what we were being told by others—and what we were telling ourselves—was true. No matter how innocently given or subtly implied, we began hearing the same words and thoughts repeatedly; hundreds, even thousands of times we were told, or we told ourselves, what we could not do, could not accomplish.

> Whatever you put into your mind—in one way or another—is what you will get back out—in one way or another.

## Everything we are comes from our thoughts

Your inner dialogue is private—no one else can hear it except you! So if you’re ever worried about what someone else might think of how you speak to yourself, remember that they don’t know! Just like most people don’t know what kind of inner dialogues other people are having with themselves all day long either!

> "Changing one's perspective or attitude towards something has the power to alter the emotions(feelings) associated with that particular activity."

> Best Hardware doesn't work if the software is not good (just as our brain's effectiveness is hampered by negative or unproductive thoughts).

## How to Reprogram the Brain Through Repetition:

Reprogramming the brain is a process that involves reshaping our thought patterns and habits. One powerful technique to achieve this transformation is through the consistent use of repetition.

## In the book "What to Say When You Talk to Yourself" by Dr. Shad Helmstetter, the author outlines five levels of self-talk, which represent different degrees of effectiveness and influence on our behavior and mindset. These levels are:

1. **Level 1 - Negative Acceptance:** At this level, individuals accept and internalize negative thoughts and beliefs about themselves without question. People limit themselves and are unable to think extraordinarily. They keep accepting their current state. This involves saying negative things about yourself and believing them. It’s characterized by words like “I can't do this,” “I will never get there,” and other negations.
2. **Level 2 - Recognition and Need to Change:** In this stage, individuals recognize that their self-talk is predominantly negative and harmful. They acknowledge the need for change and begin to question the validity of their negative beliefs. Such self-talk is characterized by words like “I need to…”, “I ought to…”, or “I should…” Examples include: “I need to lose weight” or “I really ought to be more punctual”. The statements may seem helpful, but they’re actually counterproductive because they point out a gap/problem without a concrete solution. This makes you feel more guilty and frustrated.
3. **Level 3 - Decision to Change:** At this level, individuals make a conscious decision to change their self-talk. They commit to replacing negative thoughts with positive and constructive ones. It's characterized by words like “I never…” or “I no longer…” Examples include: “I never break a promise” or “I no longer eat more than I should”. The sentences are stated in the present tense as if the change has already occurred. This instructs your subconscious mind to take action immediately.
4. **Level 4 - The Better You:** In this stage, individuals actively work on changing their self-talk patterns. They replace negative beliefs with positive affirmations and constructive self-talk. Here in this level you can say "I am better at this and I am doing good or I am good at this" whenever you do or starting to do something. Such statements inspire us to become the person we wish to be, filling us with hope and excitement.
5. **Level 5 - Universal Affirmation / Mystical:** This is the highest level of self-talk. At this stage, individuals not only use positive self-talk to improve their own lives but also extend it to contribute positively to the world around them. They believe in their ability to make a difference and embrace a mindset of empowerment and abundance. You use words that describe what is, e.g. “Life is beautiful and full of joy and peace.” Your self-talk is elevated to a higher level, reflecting a wider perspective and a higher consciousness.

## How Does the Brain Work?

Think of your brain like a computer that executes whatever instructions it receives. Just as you input data or instructions into a computer via a keyboard or touch screen, the brain receives inputs via our five senses. The programming is stored in the subconscious mind, and the results are displayed through our actions or appearance. You literally become what you see/hear/think about the most.

The subconscious mind is like the brain’s command center. It stores our programming, and has countless electrochemical “switches” that control everything from our memory to our health, attitude, fears, logic, creativity, hopes, and dreams. When we try to adopt a new success strategy, it often works for a while before we fall back to old habits governed by our old programming. The only way to change permanently is to change our underlying program.

## Where Did Your Programming Come From?

Basically, our current mental programming is the sum of what others have told us repeatedly over the years since we were born. We also talk to ourselves constantly through spoken words, silent thoughts, feelings, impressions, or physical responses, to reinforce the programming unconsciously. Your programming, in turn, shapes your beliefs, your attitudes, your feelings, your behaviors, and ultimately your results.

## Self-Talk Steps, Techniques, and Applications

Self-talk may be thought, spoken, written/read, recorded/listened to. It can also be used to change habits or attitudes, motivate yourself, solve a specific problem, or target a specific situation. The rest of Shad Helmstetter’s book explains how exactly you can move up the five self-talk levels mentioned earlier, shifting from negative self-talk to positive self-talk. This includes:

### 5 Techniques to Improve Your Self-Talk and Shift from Negative to Positive Affirmations:

1. **Silent Self-Talk** involves the conversations you have with yourself inside your mind. It's the way you think and the words you use when talking to yourself silently. To improve your self-talk, pay attention to your inner dialogue and start replacing negative or self-limiting thoughts with positive and empowering ones. For example, if you catch yourself thinking, "I can't do this," consciously replace it with "I am capable and can overcome challenges." The key is to actively monitor and adjust your thoughts to be more positive. Notice Level 1 and 2 Types of Talk and Change It with Level 3 and 4.
2. **Self-speak** refers to the way you talk to yourself out loud. It's the spoken words and phrases you use when expressing your thoughts and feelings. To improve your self-speak, start speaking to yourself in a more positive and encouraging manner. When faced with challenges or setbacks, avoid negative statements like "I'm a failure" and replace them with affirmations such as "I can learn from this experience and grow stronger." Speaking positively to yourself reinforces a constructive self-image and boosts confidence.**Talk Positive Around People and Keep Positive Company: Surrounding ourselves with positive stimuli, like affirmations.**
3. **Self Conversation**  -> Talking with yourself as a two person talking to each other in this you have to talk to yourself back and forth from this you will be able to talk in depth and it make the observation and management of your conversation more easy to control and analyze
4. **Self-write** is a technique in which you actively engage in the process of writing to improve your self-talk and shift from negative to positive affirmations.
5. **Recording self-talk**

>  is a technique where you verbally express your thoughts, emotions, and inner dialogue using an audio recording device or a smartphone. Here's how you can effectively use this technique:

* **Choose a Recording Medium:** Decide whether you want to use a digital voice recorder, a smartphone's voice memo app, or any other recording device that suits your preference. Ensure it's easily accessible to you.
* **Select a Quiet Environment:** Find a quiet and comfortable space where you can speak freely without distractions. This allows you to focus on your thoughts and emotions.
* **Start Recording:** Press the record button and begin speaking your thoughts and feelings out loud. You can talk about anything that's on your mind, including your daily experiences, challenges, and emotions. Be honest and open in your self-talk.
* **Express Emotions:** Don't hold back your emotions. If you're feeling happy, sad, frustrated, or excited, express those feelings in your recording. This process can help you gain better insight into your emotions and how they influence your self-talk.
* **Identify Negative Self-Talk:** As you speak, pay attention to any negative self-talk that emerges. These may be self-critical thoughts, doubts, or limiting beliefs. Verbalize them in your recording.
* **Challenge and Reframe:** After identifying negative self-talk, challenge and reframe these thoughts aloud. Ask yourself questions like, "Is this thought based on facts?" or "How can I rephrase this in a more positive and constructive way?" Record your efforts to reframe your thoughts.
* **Set Goals and Intentions:** Use your recording to set specific goals and intentions for personal growth and improvement. State your goals clearly and explain why they are important to you.
* **Practice Positive Affirmations:** Integrate positive affirmations and empowering statements into your recording. Speak these affirmations confidently and with conviction. Repeating them aloud can help reinforce positive self-talk.
* **Reflect and Analyze:** Periodically listen to your recorded self-talk sessions. Analyze the patterns of your thoughts and emotions. Reflect on any changes you observe in your self-talk over time.
* **Regularly Record:** Make recording self-talk a regular practice. You can do this daily, weekly, or as needed. Consistency is key to making positive changes in your inner dialogue.

Recording self-talk offers the advantage of hearing your own voice and the emotions behind your thoughts, which can provide valuable insights. It allows you to actively engage with your self-talk and work on shifting from negative to positive affirmations. Over time, this practice can help you transform your mindset and improve your overall well-being.
